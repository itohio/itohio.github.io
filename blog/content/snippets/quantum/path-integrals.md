## Feynman's Principle

Quantum amplitude is sum over all possible paths:

$$
\langle x_f|e^{-iHt/\hbar}|x_i\rangle = \int \mathcal{D}[x(t)] e^{iS[x]/\hbar}
$$

Where $S[x]$ is the classical action:

$$
S[x] = \int_0^t L(x, \dot{x}, t') dt'
$$

## Key Idea

- Classical mechanics: One path (least action)
- Quantum mechanics: All paths contribute
- Paths near classical path contribute most

## Applications

- Quantum field theory
- Statistical mechanics
- Quantum computing
