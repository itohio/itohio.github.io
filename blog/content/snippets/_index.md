title: "Code Snippets"
---

Collection of useful code snippets, commands, and techniques organized by category. When I stumble upon something I try to document it.
Sometimes documentation is limited to whatever I store in my memory... Therefore most of these snippets are recreated with the help of LLMs or
tidied up by it from my recollections.

The idea behind the snippets is that I come across them rarely, but when I do I have to find or reinvent them from scratch since my ADHD brain throws them right away after I use them. Some are just helpful reminders.
