Comprehensive AI/ML and LLM interview questions covering fundamental concepts, algorithms, and practical applications.

## AI/ML Fundamentals

Interview questions covering core machine learning concepts, algorithms, and best practices:

- **Easy**: Supervised/unsupervised learning, overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, basic algorithms
- **Medium**: Backpropagation, ensemble methods, SVMs, dimensionality reduction
- **Hard**: Attention mechanisms, Transformers, VAEs, GANs

## LLM & Agentic AI

Interview questions focused on Large Language Models and agent-based AI systems:

- **Easy**: What are LLMs, prompt engineering, temperature, agents, RAG
- **Medium**: ReAct agents, advanced RAG, agent memory, tool calling
- **Hard**: Multi-agent systems, production optimization, advanced architectures

All examples include LangChain implementations and Mermaid diagrams for visual explanations.
