Comprehensive research methodology and technical due diligence interview questions for evaluating technology, teams, and systems.

## Research Methodology

Interview questions covering scientific research methods and experimental design:

- **Easy**: Research problem definition, literature review, basic experimental design, hypothesis testing
- **Medium**: Advanced experimental designs (between/within subjects, factorial), confounding variables, power analysis, meta-analysis, research bias, A/B testing, regression analysis, missing data, causal inference, reproducibility
- **Hard**: Bayesian vs. Frequentist statistics, complex RCTs, structural equation modeling, multiple testing, time series analysis, mixed methods, ML for causal inference, survival analysis, network experiments, Bayesian hierarchical models

## Technical Due Diligence

Interview questions for assessing technology stacks, teams, and technical capabilities:

- **Easy**: What is tech DD, key assessment areas, code quality, technical debt, security review, scalability assessment, team evaluation, documentation, infrastructure, common red flags
- **Medium**: Architecture review, data architecture, API quality, testing strategy, deployment processes, observability, IP & licensing, scalability limits, disaster recovery, team processes
- **Hard**: Technical debt quantification, technology stack future-proofing, organizational capabilities, multi-region scalability, security posture, innovation vs. stability, M&A integration, AI/ML maturity, risk management, comprehensive DD reports
