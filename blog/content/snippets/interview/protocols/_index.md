Comprehensive protocol design and distributed systems interview questions covering networking, communication protocols, and distributed consensus.

## Network Protocols

Interview questions covering fundamental and advanced networking concepts:

- **Easy**: OSI model, TCP vs UDP, DNS, HTTP, REST APIs, WebSocket, authentication
- **Medium**: HTTP/2, gRPC, distributed consensus (Raft/Paxos), message queues, idempotency, rate limiting, circuit breakers, service mesh, event sourcing, distributed tracing
- **Hard**: Custom protocol design, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, distributed locks, distributed transactions, CDN protocols, QUIC/HTTP3, gossip protocols, vector clocks, distributed rate limiting, blockchain consensus

## Protocol Design

Topics include:

- Transport layer protocols (TCP, UDP, QUIC)
- Application layer protocols (HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC)
- Distributed consensus algorithms
- Custom protocol design for specific use cases
- Real-time communication protocols
- Content delivery networks
- Peer-to-peer protocols

## Distributed Systems Patterns

- Consensus mechanisms (Raft, Paxos, PBFT)
- Distributed locking and coordination
- Message queues and pub/sub
- Event sourcing and CQRS
- Circuit breakers and resilience patterns
- Service mesh architectures
- Distributed tracing and observability
