## Core Web Technologies

Fundamental concepts every frontend developer should know:

- **HTML & DOM**: Document structure, DOM manipulation, semantic HTML
- **CSS**: Box model, flexbox, grid, positioning, responsive design
- **JavaScript**: ES6+, async/await, closures, prototypes, event loop
- **Browser APIs**: Fetch, LocalStorage, Intersection Observer, Web Workers

## React

Interview questions covering React fundamentals and advanced patterns:

- **Easy**: Components, props, state, hooks (useState, useEffect), lifecycle, Virtual DOM
- **Medium**: Context API, useCallback/useMemo, useReducer, reconciliation, keys, CSS-in-JS, Portals, code splitting
- **Hard**: Fiber architecture, concurrent features, custom hooks, SSR & hydration, optimistic UI, micro-frontends, performance optimization

## Vue.js

Interview questions covering Vue 2, Vue 3, and the Composition API:

- **Easy**: Template syntax, directives (v-if, v-for, v-model), components, reactivity basics, Options API vs Composition API
- **Medium**: Vuex state management, composables, watchers vs computed, lifecycle hooks

- Web Workers for heavy computation
- Request deduplication and caching
- Bundle analysis and tree shaking

## Advanced Topics

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Hydration, data fetching, Next.js, Nuxt.js
- **Micro-Frontends**: Module Federation, independent deployment
- **State Machines**: XState, finite state management
- **Forms**: Validation, error handling, advanced form libraries
- **Real-time**: WebSockets, collaborative editing, Operational Transformation, CRDTs
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
